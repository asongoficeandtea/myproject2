# Micro-Services Project

## Project overview

> The aim of this project was to consolidate concepts from previous training modules, including:

* Software Development with Python
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Fundamentals
  
### Tools utilised

* Github
* Jenkins
* Ansible
* Docker (Swarm and Compose)


### Design Process

* ERD diagram 
    * Win table where all the prizes were recorded

### Application Development

> Application was developed locally using VS Code and GCP database instance.

#### Unit testing

> Challenge as the testing was erratic at times. Most of the app has been tested but there are faults still there. 

### Risk Assessment

* Limitations
    * Unable to build in pipeline due to issues in connecting to jenkins user
    * ssh jenkins agent proved challenging and the issue could not be recolved in time

## Conclusion

* Much improvement in using python and producing code
* Understanding of using Ansible, Docker including Docker Compose and Swarm is demonstrated in this project
* Will improve on managing Jenkins pipeline including Jenkins agents
